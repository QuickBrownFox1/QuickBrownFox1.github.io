    <h1>Teachers</h1>
    <h2>How can I incorporate this into my lessons?</h2>
    <p>The game was built around students who are learning English as a second language. With the exception of level 7 which pulls from a list of the 500 most used words in the English language. I like to use this game to help re-enforce new words that have been 
      taught, practice spelling old words and building the students reading levels in a fun and interesting way. </p>
    <h2>The levels explained</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Level 1</b> - Made of cvc words that correspond with multiple textbooks. Funfonix is one that is particularly useful</li>
      <li><b>Level 2</b> - Made up of more cvc words and the FunFonix words from level 2 and 3 textbooks</li>
      <li><b>Level 3</b> - Made up of cvc words from FunFonix and Grade 3 words, using popular Key vocabulary words found Korea's national English syllabus</li>
      <li><b>Level 4</b> - Made up of Grade 4 words using popular Key vocabulary words found in Korea's national English syllabus</li>
      <li><b>Level 5</b> - Made up of Grade 5 words using popular Key vocabulary words found in Korea's national English syllabus</li>
      <li><b>Level 6</b> - Made up of Grade 6 wirds using popular Key vocabulary words found in Korea's national English syllabus</li>
      <li><b>Level 7</b> - This is a collection of the top 500 most used words in English</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In an attempt to moderate the word lists effectively, I typed each word in myself. Which has amounted to over a thousand words aside from the other game related code, this means that all of the words in this 
      game are appropriate for students. There should be no spelling errors. However, I am only human. So if you do come across one please reach out and let me know!</p>
    <h2>Adding words</h2>
    <p>At present there is no way for users to add new words to the test. However, if you are a teacher and would like for me to add something relevant to your syllabus please reach out to me and I will see what I can do.</p>
