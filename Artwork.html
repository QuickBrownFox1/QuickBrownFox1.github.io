    <h1>Artwork</h1>
    <p>All of the artwork (aside from any of the Pico-8 assets) is made by me in the Pico-8 sprite editor tool. This tool has a limited colour palette and limited space to work in. You can see an example of this below.</p>
    <h2>Foxy</h2>
    <p>Below you can see a screenshot of Foxy and her different poses.</p> 
    <img src="assets/fox.png" height="600" padding="25%" alt="Pixel art fox">
    <h2>Background Elements</h2>
    <p>Below you can see some of the background elements draw in game, the blue sky, green grass and orange leaves are all drawn in real time. The leaves are random and will change with each playthrough.</p>
    <img src="assets/tree.png" height="600" padding="25%" alt="Pixel art tree">
    <p>In time I intend to update the visual elements of the game to fit the seasons. So these images will change, as will the background. Foxy will stay the same, although I may add new moves to her repertoire.</p>
